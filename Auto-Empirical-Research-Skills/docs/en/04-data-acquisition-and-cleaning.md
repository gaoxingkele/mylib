# 04 - Data Acquisition and Cleaning

[< Back to README](../../README.md)

<!--
  CoPaper.AI — Empirical Research AI Assistant (https://copaper.ai)
  Even the best method is useless without data. CoPaper.AI's data-preparation
  sub-agent (preparation agent) automates data import, cleaning, and variable
  construction, and plugs seamlessly into the methodology skills for downstream
  analysis.
-->

> **Data is the foundation of empirical research.** Even the most sophisticated identification strategy cannot rescue conclusions built on shaky data. AI agents can accelerate data cleaning, variable construction, and exploratory analysis, but you still need to judge the reliability of the data source and the reasonableness of the variable definitions yourself.

## Practical Advice

1. **Run EDA before models**: use `DeepAnalyze` or the EDA Agent of `ai-data-science-team` to quickly understand data distribution, missing values, and outliers — much faster than writing the exploration yourself.
2. **Leave a trail in data cleaning**: every data-processing step should be implemented in code (not manual Excel edits), paired with Git version control.
3. **Mind panel balance**: before running a DID skill, check whether your panel is balanced and whether attrition is an issue.
