# Empirical-Skills Expansion — 2026-06

This pass added **13 vetted, open-source, no-paid-core agent skills** (collections
`51`–`63`, **75 `SKILL.md` files**) to the catalog, chosen to fill concrete gaps in
the existing 54-collection set. Every addition is a curated upstream snapshot with
`SKILL.md` frontmatter, an attributed `README-original.md`, and an upstream `LICENSE`
(or an explicit provenance note where upstream ships none).

Selection bar (per [`SKILL_SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md`](../SKILL_SUBMISSION_GUIDE.md)): open
source with a clear license; runnable/inspectable **without** a paid or proprietary
core; safe for an agent to read (no credential exfiltration, reverse shells, hidden
download-and-run, or prompt injection); relevant to empirical research; and not a
duplicate of an already-vendored owner/repo.

## What was added

¹ `econstack` and `citation-checker` declare MIT in their README (badge / `## License`
section) but ship no separate `LICENSE` file upstream; recorded with
`source_confidence: medium` in [`provenance.json`](../../catalog/provenance.json).

### Curation notes

- **CausalPy** — only the `causalpy/skills/` component is vendored (3 method skills +
  reference cards), not the package source; the dev-workflow skills under
  `.github/skills/` were excluded.
- **scdenney/open-science-skills** — Claude-native skills only. The `-codex` variants
  (which call the OpenAI API) and the `presubmit` setup skill (which `eval`s the user's
  shell rc to locate `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) were **excluded** to keep the snapshot
  no-paid-core and read-safe.
- **edgartools** — only `edgar/ai/skills/` (the agent-skill bundle) is vendored, not the
  Python package.
- **econstack** — skill definitions + supporting `facts/` and `templates/` markdown only;
  the upstream `bin/` and `scripts/*.sh` executables and `tests/` were not vendored.

## Security review summary

Executable surface in the new collections is small and was read end-to-end:

- `62/scripts/citation_checker.py` — HTTP **GET** only to `api.crossref.org`,
  `api.semanticscholar.org`, `api.openalex.org` (free scholarly APIs). No shell, no
  exfiltration.
- `60/skills/compile-latex/scripts/compile.sh` — standard multi-pass LaTeX compiler
  (`set -euo pipefail`, engine auto-detect). No network.
- `57/.../content/skill.yaml` — local SVG→PNG via `inkscape subprocess` (chart export).
- `55/.../rlang-patterns/SKILL.md:238` — `eval(parse())` appears only as a labelled
  **anti-pattern example** ("# Dangerous!"), not executed.

No `curl|bash`, reverse shells, base64-piped execution, or credential exfiltration was
found in vendored content. (The upstream `README-original.md` for `56` documents an
upstream `curl … | bash` installer; AERS vendors the skill directly, so that path is
informational only.)

## Ready-to-paste README rows (for the maintainer)

`README.md` / `README-zh.md` were being edited concurrently in the shared worktree
during this pass, so they were intentionally **not** touched here. The rows below can be
dropped into the relevant README tables when convenient.

Rows link to upstream GitHub (matching the README's existing external-link style); the
local vendored path is noted as `skills/NN` in the function column.

## Vetted backlog (not vendored this pass)

**Deferred — strong content, but license-blocked** (re-check if upstream adds an OSI/CC
license):

- `HaipingXu/social-science-claude-scholar` — staggered/Callaway-Sant'Anna/Sun-Abraham/Bartik causal skill; **no LICENSE**.
- `franklee16/academic-research-skills`, `lingzhi227/agent-research-skills`,
  `nimrodfisher/data-analytics-skills`, `johanfourieza/econtools`,
  `lcrawfurd/claude-skills` (Cunningham referee-2 reproducibility audit) — all **no top-level LICENSE**.

**Rejected on closer inspection:**

- `beita6969/ScienceClaw` (MIT, ~829★) — on tree inspection this is the sprawling
  *OpenClaw* multi-app monorepo (Android/iOS/macOS apps + messaging-platform extensions);
  it exposes no clean, focused econometrics skill worth vendoring. The 829★ are for the
  platform, not an empirical-methods skill. **Not vendored.**

**Deferred — acceptable but lower priority / overlap** (candidates for a future wave):

- `flonat/claude-research` (MIT) — `causal-design` + `pipeline-manifest`; broad, some overlap with 60/61.
- `ondata/skills` (CC-BY-SA-4.0 + GPL-3.0) — OpenAlex + open-data quality scoring.
- `smartbiblia-solutions/agent-skills` (MIT) — OpenAlex/HAL/Sudoc bibliometric pipeline.
- `posit-dev/skills` (MIT) — vendor only `quarto-authoring`.

**Gaps with no clean candidate found** (June 2026): a standalone, licensed skill for
local projections / impulse responses, spatial econometrics, MRP / survey weighting, or
`metafor`-style meta-analysis forest plots. These exist only as sub-sections inside
broader skills, not as dedicated licensed repos.

## Coordination & handoff

- **Branch / worktree:** committed on `bench/empirical-benchmark-depth` in the primary
  worktree, which was **shared with a concurrent agent** working on
  benchmark / eval-harness / repo-hygiene tooling. To avoid entangling work, this pass
  staged **only its own paths** with explicit pathspecs and never ran `git add -A`.
- **Files intentionally not touched** (concurrent edits in flight): `README.md`,
  `README-zh.md`, `Makefile`, `scripts/validate-repo.py`, `benchmark/**`,
  `eval-harness/**`, `tests/**`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
  `.github/workflows/quality-evals.yml`, `docs/QUALITY_GATE.md`,
  `docs/agent-worklog-bench.md`, `docs/FAQ.md`.
- **Generated files** were rebuilt with `make catalog` (provenance, skill-audit, catalog,
  enriched catalog, license audit) and committed alongside the source. `make validate`
  is clean.
- **Provenance source of truth:** `scripts/build-provenance.py` `OVERRIDES` gained one
  entry per new collection (source URL, license, snapshot note).
- **Follow-ups for the maintainer:** (1) paste the README rows above; (2) optionally pull
  from the vetted backlog in a future wave.
