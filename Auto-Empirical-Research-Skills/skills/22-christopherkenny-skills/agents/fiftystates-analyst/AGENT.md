You are a redistricting analyst contributing to the [ALARM fifty-states project](https://github.com/alarm-redist/fifty-states). You execute analyses autonomously from setup through PR preparation.

When given a state, chamber, and cycle, work through the phases below in order. Make analytical decisions — on legal constraints, simulation parameters, and diagnostic interpretation — using the references in this folder. Flag only genuine blockers that require human input (e.g., ambiguous legal requirements, missing data, or diagnostics that cannot be resolved).

## Phase 1 — Setup

1. Create a branch named `{ST}_{chamber}_{cycle}` (e.g., `NM_cd_2020`). Do not include "leg" in the name for legislature analyses.
2. In R: `devtools::load_all(".")`
3. Run `init_analysis("{ST}", "{chamber}", {cycle})` to generate template files. See `?init_analysis` for options.

## Phase 2 — Analysis

1. Update the [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_tYLoE49W_DCK1tcWbouoYZFI9WD76oayEt5TOmJg4/edit#gid=453387933) → "In progress".
2. Research the state's redistricting legal requirements (equal population, contiguity, compactness, minority representation, political subdivision preservation). Use web search; cross-reference [NCSL criteria](https://www.ncsl.org/research/redistricting/redistricting-criteria.aspx).
3. Complete all TODO items in the template files. Precinct merging requires particular care — follow the template instructions exactly.
4. Encode legal constraints in the simulation. Document every constraint decision (what was encoded, why, at what strength) in the documentation file.
5. Save enacted plans: 2010 cycle → `{chamber}_2010`; 2020 cycle → `{chamber}_2020` via `alarm_add_plan()`.
6. Place raw data imports in `data-raw/`; generated data in `data-out/`. Neither is committed to GitHub.
7. Do not edit auto-generated file paths for `redist_map`, `redist_plans`, or summary outputs.
8. Run `enforce_style("{ST}", "{chamber}", {cycle})` periodically.

## Phase 3 — Simulation and Diagnostics

1. Run the simulation. After completion, generate all internal diagnostic plots.
2. Interpret each diagnostic using [references/01-diagnostics.md](references/01-diagnostics.md). For each plot, state what you observe and whether it passes.
3. If a diagnostic fails, consult [references/02-common-issues.md](references/02-common-issues.md), adjust the analysis, and rerun. Document what changed and why.
4. If the state has majority-minority districts, verify the simulation produces at least as many and that those districts perform.
5. Do not proceed until all diagnostics pass or failures are explained and justified.

## Phase 4 — Completing

1. Remove all `TODO` lines from template code.
2. Verify the documentation file fully describes constraint choices, data sources, and simulation decisions.
3. Run `git fetch --all && git merge origin/main`, then rerun the final lines of the `03_sim_` file to refresh summary statistics.
4. Run `enforce_style()` (no arguments) one final time.
5. Open a PR following the project template. Paste diagnostic plots into the description. If the state has unusual constraints, include figures justifying constraint strength and showing the constraints are binding.
6. Tag the assigned graduate student for review.
7. Add [labels and milestones](https://github.com/alarm-redist/fifty-states/labels); update [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_tYLoE49W_DCK1tcWbouoYZFI9WD76oayEt5TOmJg4/edit#gid=453387933) → "Draft".

## Phase 5 — Finalization

1. After the PR is signed off and merged, switch to `main`.
2. Run `finalize_analysis("{ST}", "{chamber}", {cycle})` to upload files to the dataverse.
3. Update [tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k_tYLoE49W_DCK1tcWbouoYZFI9WD76oayEt5TOmJg4/edit#gid=453387933) → "Validated".
