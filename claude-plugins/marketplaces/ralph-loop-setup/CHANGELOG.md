All notable changes to the Ralph Loop Setup plugin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **Dynamic verify command from prd.json** - Add `verifyCommand` field to prd.json top-level to override the default VERIFY_COMMAND in both stop hook and fresh-context script. No more manual syncing between scripts when switching project focus.
- **`last_assistant_message` support** - Stop hook now uses the modern `last_assistant_message` field from Claude Code's Stop hook input instead of parsing transcript JSON. Falls back to transcript parsing for older versions.
- **Fresh-context state file cleanup** - `ralph-stop.sh` now cleans up `.claude/ralph-state.local.md` (fresh-context mode) in addition to `.claude/ralph-loop.local.md` (same-session mode)

### Changed
- **`allowed-tools` updated** - Replaced deprecated `TodoWrite` with `TaskCreate, TaskUpdate, TaskList` in ralph-loop command template
- **Branch field compatibility** - `ralph-fresh.sh` now reads `branchName` (Pitchello convention) OR `branch` from prd.json via `.branchName // .branch`
- **Gitignore guidance** - Setup docs now list all three state files that should be gitignored

### Fixed
- Fresh-context state file (`.claude/ralph-state.local.md`) was not included in gitignore guidance, causing untracked file pollution after runs

## [1.3.3] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Corrected plugin update command in README** - Update command requires `plugin-name@marketplace-name` format (`ralph-loop-setup@ralph-loop-setup`), not just plugin name
- Added note explaining how to find full plugin name with `claude plugin list`
- Changed commands to use `claude plugin` CLI format for clarity

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **One-task-per-iteration enforcement** - Fresh-context mode was completing ALL tasks in single iteration; changed "end normally" to explicit "EXIT immediately - do NOT continue to other tasks"
- **GitHub issue reference in commit messages** - Added `Fixes #[github_issue]` format to commit instructions for auto-closing issues when PRs merge

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **Renamed `--snapshots` to `--screenshots`** - Correct Playwright terminology (snapshot = DOM/accessibility tree, screenshot = visual PNG)
- Removed references to never-implemented `snapshot.ts` and `snapshot-config.json` files
- Simplified screenshot feature to use Playwright MCP directly via `browser_take_screenshot`
- Updated documentation in SKILL.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md, and command templates

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Token usage tracking** - Monitor now displays input/output tokens, cache reads, and cost per run
- **--screenshot flag** - Instructs Claude to capture UI screenshots via Playwright MCP after iterations
- JSON output format parsing to extract token metrics from Claude CLI

### Changed
- Ralph fresh-context mode now uses `--output-format json` for richer metadata
- Status file includes token accumulation across iterations
- Monitor dashboard displays cost-to-date with formatted numbers

## [1.2.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **ralph-stop.sh** - Unified stop script that kills processes for both fresh-context and same-session modes
- **ralph-planner.md** - New command template for planning tasks from GitHub issues
- **CLAUDE.md** - Plugin maintenance guide with version management rules and self-update checklist
- **CHANGELOG.md** - This file for tracking version history

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `/cancel-ralph` to `/ralph-cancel` for consistent namespace
- Updated SKILL.md with documentation for all new features
- Updated templates list to include new files

### Fixed
- Completion promise detection now only checks last 10 lines to avoid false positives

## [1.1.0] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Skip field support** - Tasks with `skip: true` are excluded from automation
- **Vertical split monitoring** - iTerm2 opens split pane instead of new window
- **--verbose flag** - Detailed timing and output in fresh-context mode
- **--monitor flag** - Auto-open status dashboard
- **ralph-status.sh** - Status dashboard with live watch mode
- **ralph-tail.sh** - Log tail helper for following iteration output
- **SIGN-005** - Guardrail for skipping manual tasks
- **SIGN-006** - Guardrail for referencing GitHub issues in commits

### Changed
- Updated prd-template.json with `skip` and `skipReason` fields
- Dashboard shows skipped tasks with distinct indicator
- Improved task selection to exclude skipped tasks

### Fixed
- Safe JSON construction in update_status using jq
