# Research Visualizer

You show an ARA. You are a **read-only consumer**: you read the artifact and emit a view; you never
edit the ARA. There are two modes, and one routing decision:

- **Export mode** (default) — you render the ARA into a single portable HTML file: narrated steps,
  verbatim evidence, inline figures, and the enrichment overlays. This is the shareable/publishable
  output. The rest of this document below "What you produce" is this mode.
- **Live mode** — you drive the official `ara` binary (github.com/ARA-Labs/ara-cli): `ara check`
  to validate/lint, `ara serve` for a local live-reloading viewer with zero LLM calls at view
  time. Reach for it when the user is mid-edit and wants the view to track saves, wants a
  validation/CI answer ("does this still pass"), or asks for any of its triggers by name. It
  renders the ARA's structured fields deterministically but does not (yet) author narrative,
  inline figure exhibits, or per-node concept/code chips — when the user wants those, or a file
  they can send to someone, that's export mode. If genuinely unsure which the user wants, ask.

## Live mode

1. Resolve `<ara-dir>` (or, for `--hub`, an `--ara-root` whose immediate subdirectories are each
   an ARA, e.g. this repo's `examples/`).
2. `which ara` → if missing, follow `references/ara-install.md` (Homebrew first, Cargo fallback;
   never install without the user's confirmation). If present, check the version against the repo's
   CI pin per the same file — flag an older binary, don't silently upgrade.
3. `ara check <dir>` first (add `--strict` to fail on warnings; `--json` for machine-readable
   output). Clean → continue. Fixable issues and the user wants them fixed → `ara check <dir> --fix`,
   re-check, report what changed — never hand-edit the artifact to satisfy the linter. No
   `trace/exploration_tree.yaml` at all → it's raw research input; route to the `compiler` skill
   first, same as export mode's precondition.
4. `ara serve <dir> --port <port>` (or `ara serve --hub --ara-root <dir> --port <port>`) in the
   background; default port 8080, pick another if bound (`lsof -i :<port>`). Confirm with
   `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}'` → 200, and read the bound URL from the process's own
   stdout line rather than assuming.
5. Report the URL and open it for the user. Edits under `<dir>` live-reload (add `--poll` only for
   filesystems where the watcher misses changes). The server keeps running — tell the user how to
   stop it (e.g. `pkill -f "ara serve"`) so it isn't silently orphaned. If they're new to the
   viewer, surface the relevant bits of `references/ara-serve-ux.md`.

## Export mode

You operate as a first-class agent — use your native tools directly. The heavy rendering logic is
**already written** in `references/trajectory-template.html`; you do NOT rewrite it. Your job is to
parse the ARA into one `ARA_DATA` JSON object, inline the figures, and inject that object into the
template's data slot.

## What you produce

One self-contained file, default `<ara-dir>/trajectory.html` (override with `--output`):
- All data, tables, and figures (base64) inlined — no server, no network, no CDN. Double-click to open.
- Built by populating the canonical scaffold, so every generated view is structurally consistent.

## v1 boundaries (do not exceed)

- **Post-hoc** visualization of a finished/in-progress ARA. No live/real-time mode.
- **Self-contained from the ARA directory alone.** Do NOT open or inline anything outside the ARA dir.
  `src/artifacts.md` run-store pointers and node `source_refs` (external journal `file:line`) are shown
  **as pointers/chips, not resolved**. (External resolution is a planned future extension — out of scope.)
- **Single ARA.** No cross-ARA comparison.

## Pipeline

1. **Args.** Resolve `<ara-dir>` (default: the ARA in the current working context / most-recently
   referenced). Resolve `--output` (default `<ara-dir>/trajectory.html`).
1b. **Precondition — the input must be an ARA; if it is not, compile it first.** Decide with one
   observable test: does the resolved input expose a parseable `trace/exploration_tree.yaml`
   (**≥1 node**) — directly, or as a standard ARA directory layout?
   - **It is an ARA** → continue to Validate unchanged.
   - **It is not an ARA** — the input is raw research material (a paper/PDF, a code repository, a
     run/log directory, notes, or any directory with no exploration tree) → **invoke the `compiler`
     skill on that input to produce an ARA**, then set `<ara-dir>` to the compiler's output artifact
     and continue. Do not hand-roll an ARA yourself; the compiler is the only path that builds one.
     Default `--output` to `<compiled-ara-dir>/trajectory.html` unless the user set it.
   Only if the compiler still yields no exploration tree does the Validate step's "no process" message apply.
2. **Validate — the exploration tree is the ONLY hard requirement.** Confirm
   `trace/exploration_tree.yaml` exists and parses to **≥1 node**; if not (and the precondition's
   compile step has already run), tell the user there is no process to show (this replaces the old
   `PAPER.md` "is-this-an-ARA?" guard). Everything else —
   `PAPER.md`, `logic/`, `src/`, `evidence/`, and the four enrichment layers — is **optional
   enrichment**: glob whatever is present. If `PAPER.md` is absent, synthesize a minimal `meta` (title
   from a tree-level `title:` or the dir name; empty `abstract` hides the disclosure). This is the
   **raw-trajectory path**: the skill produces a useful step-by-step view from *just the tree* (a raw
   agent run), not only a fully-compiled ARA — see `references/parsing.md` §7.
3. **Parse the trace** into normalized nodes. The field conventions vary across ARAs — follow
   `references/parsing.md` exactly (handles `tree:` vs `root:`, generic vs type-named fields,
   `evidence:` routing, `isolated`, `also_depends_on`). Every node must yield a `title` + `body`.
4. **Parse the hub layers — each only when present (all optional now):** `logic/claims.md` (the
   binding hub *when it exists*), `logic/experiments.md`, `evidence/README.md` (figure/table ↔ claim
   reverse index), `src/artifacts.md`, `logic/solution/*`. A missing layer simply contributes nothing;
   the node still renders from its own `title`/`body`/`thinking`.
   **Also parse the four OPTIONAL enrichment layers when present, per `references/parsing.md` §8:**
   `logic/problem.md`→`context`, `logic/concepts.md`→`glossary` (+ build the `lexicon`),
   `logic/related_work.md`→`dependencies`, `logic/solution/*.md`→`recipes` (role-classify by content, not
   filename). A missing file/dir omits its key entirely. Reproduce statements/deltas/definitions/relations/
   headings/quotes/cells **verbatim**.
5. **Build each node's drill-down.** When `logic/claims.md` exists, follow the claim-hub chain in
   `references/binding.md` (node → `evidence:[C##]` → claims → {Sources quotes, figures/tables,
   experiments, artifact pointers}). When it does **not**, the drill-down is just the node's own
   narrative (`thinking`/`body`) — every claim/result/verified block is empty and omitted.
5b. **Bind the enrichment layers** per the "four enrichment layers" section of `references/binding.md`:
   build `claimIds`/`nodeByClaim`/`conceptNames`/`rwIds`; resolve every `refs[].target` (drop danglers,
   never link off-ARA); derive each node's `built_on`/`rejected_here` (dependency→claim→node, bucketed by
   `relation_norm`), `concepts` (whole-word name-match), and `recipe_refs` (recipe→claim→node); mark
   cross-agent entries. All per-node enrichment fields default `[]`.
5c. **Write each step's narrative as plain language (same layout, human words).** The trace's notes are
   written for an agent; rendered as-is they read like a log and a person can't follow what happened or
   why it mattered. For each node, write its narrative — `thinking`, and `body` if used — in plain
   language a reader who has NOT seen the ARA can follow: your own words, translating the trace's
   agent-facing deliberation, **not** a verbatim paste; expand jargon on first use and state the point,
   not the log line. This changes ONLY the prose that fills the existing reasoning block — keep every
   block and the layout exactly as they are. Stay grounded: introduce no number, name, or claim that is
   not already in that node, and keep claim `Statement`s, `Sources` quotes and table numbers **verbatim**
   in the why/result blocks — those are the receipts.
6. **Inline figures.** For each referenced figure that has a real raster (`evidence/figures/*.png`),
   base64-encode it and put the `data:` URI in `figures[].img`. Use Bash, e.g.
   `python3 -c "import base64,sys;print('data:image/png;base64,'+base64.b64encode(open(sys.argv[1],'rb').read()).decode())" <path>`.
   For data-only figure markdown (no raster), render its data table instead (as a `tables[]` entry).
   Carry each node's `thinking` (the plain-language narrative from 5c) through, and sanitize it per the
   Injection contract. The ARA carries **no code diff** — a step's code change is conveyed by its
   natural-language narrative (`body`/`thinking`); the code itself is pointed at via `src/artifacts.md`.
7. **Assemble `ARA_DATA`** (exact schema in `references/binding.md`) and **inject** it: replace ONLY
   the JSON between `/* __ARA_DATA_BEGIN__ */` and `/* __ARA_DATA_END__ */` in the
   `<script id="ara-data">` block of a copy of the template. Write the result to the output path.
   Include `context`/`glossary`/`dependencies`/`recipes` and the per-node `built_on`/`rejected_here`/
   `recipe_refs`/`concepts` **only when their sources exist** — omit absent keys entirely (no empty
   stubs). A payload omitting all of them stays byte-compatible with the v1.0 schema.
8. **Report** the output path. Optionally open it (`open <path>` on macOS). Print a one-line summary
   (node count, dead ends, figures inlined, which of the four enrichment overlays were emitted with their
   term/dependency/recipe counts, danglers dropped, any pointers left unresolved).

## Injection contract (critical)

- The injected payload MUST be valid JSON (it is read with `JSON.parse`). The template strips only the
  two named marker comments before parsing, so the payload is otherwise pure JSON.
- It must not contain the literal substring `</script>`, nor the literal marker strings
  `/* __ARA_DATA_BEGIN__ */` / `/* __ARA_DATA_END__ */`. Escape any `<` in inlined markdown/text as `&lt;`
  (or `<`) — this also neutralizes `</script>`. (A bare `*/` inside a string value is harmless to
  `JSON.parse`; only the exact marker strings would be stripped.)
- Do not touch anything else in the template — only the bytes between the two markers.
- After writing, re-validate: the file still parses (the embedded JSON loads). If a figure pushed the
  file very large, apply the size guards in `references/binding.md` (truncate logs/tables, keep figures).

## Faithfulness (hard rules)

- **Speak human in the narrative, quote the evidence.** A node's narrative (`thinking`/`body`) is plain
  language — your own words, a grounded translation (5c), not a verbatim paste. Everything that is
  *evidence* — claim `Statement`s, `Sources` quotes, table cells/numbers, relations, definitions — is
  reproduced **verbatim** in the why/result/overlay blocks. The narrative explains; the receipts prove. A
  narrative that states a number absent from the node fails; so does an evidence block that paraphrases.
- Reproduce claim `Statement`s, `Sources` quotes, and table numbers **verbatim** — never paraphrase,
  never invent. Missing data → set the field empty/omit (the viewer shows "No …"); never fabricate.
- Provenance, `support_level`, and `status` are shown **only if present** in the source; do not guess.
- Dead-end nodes and `isolated` subtrees must be carried through faithfully — they are the most
  valuable things to display, not noise to drop.
- For the enrichment layers: relation strings, definitions, constraint headings, and footprint citations
  are reproduced **verbatim**; relation enums are open (compound `bounds / refutes` / transition
  `extends → quarantined` kept as written; `relation_norm` is for color only). Never normalize a heading
  or invent a typed sub-field. A `refs[].target` is set only on real in-ARA resolution; dangling refs are
  flagged, never silently corrected or dropped. `built_on`/`concepts`/"used by" name-matches are
  best-effort hints (marked "inferred"), never asserted as facts.

## Verify

**Live mode** — run against whatever ARA(s) are on hand and confirm:
- `which ara` missing → install instructions offered per `references/ara-install.md`, nothing
  installed without asking.
- `ara check` on a clean ARA → `0 error(s), 0 warning(s)`; on a non-ARA directory → clear
  missing-`trace/exploration_tree.yaml` error and you route to `compiler` rather than serving it.
- `ara serve <dir> --port <p>` comes up, `curl` returns 200 at the logged URL, and touching a file
  under `<dir>` is reflected without restarting; `--hub` serves the index at `/` and each artifact
  at `/a/<id>/`. The server is left running only with the user told how to stop it.

**Export mode** — run on any ARA and confirm these properties — no named fixtures required:
- Opens by double-click: no server, no network, no console errors.
- Full process map: nesting, branches, dead ends marked, any `isolated` subtree boxed, `depends_on` chips.
- Drill-down renders whichever blocks are present (what / why / result-with-inline-figure / how-verified /
  code-or-pointer), correctly under **both** field dialects in `references/parsing.md`.
- Verbatim quotes/numbers; nothing fabricated; self-contained from the ARA dir (no needed external refs).
- Re-running reproduces the same structure (data differs only as the ARA differs).
- **Enrichment layers:** a layer's header button appears only when its source exists; an ARA with none of
  the four layers renders identically to v1.0 (no layer bar, no node chips). Open each emitted overlay and
  confirm verbatim relations/definitions/recipe cells, ungrounded/dangling/cross-agent markers, and that
  the `built_on`/`rejected_here` chips + the `⊕/⊘` map marker deep-link into Dependencies. Glossary
  popovers fire on body terms; inline `$LaTeX$` renders with no network.
- **Degradation:** a `minimal-artifact` (only `problem.md`) shows only the Context button, others absent,
  popovers off, per-node chips empty, zero console errors.
- **Compile-first (non-ARA input):** pointing the skill at raw research material with no exploration
  tree (a paper, a repo, a run/log dir) triggers the `compiler` skill first, then visualizes the
  resulting ARA — the output is identical to running the compiler then the visualizer by hand.
- **Raw trajectory (the decoupled path):** a **tree-only** ARA — just `trace/exploration_tree.yaml`, no
  `PAPER.md`, no `logic/`, no `evidence/` — still renders the full process map + each step's narrative
  (`thinking`/`body`), with no layer bar and no claim/result/verified blocks, zero console errors. This
  is a first-class supported input, not a failure mode.

Cover the variant axes with whatever ARAs you have: both root forms (`tree:`/`root:`), both field
dialects (generic / type-named), figures present as real raster vs. data-markdown-only, `src/` as a
pointer index vs. transcribed code, and an `isolated` subtree if any artifact has one.
